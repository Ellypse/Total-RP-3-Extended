## Bug fixes

- Fixed bugs introduced with 7.2 in inspection and inventory frame.
- The drop and stashes systems are now "per realm" and not global to your account anymore. The first realm you will log-in will be used to migrate all existing droped/stashed items.

## Improvement

- Improved cutscene attributes section. Users should now better understand that the checkbox must be checked to change an attribute.
